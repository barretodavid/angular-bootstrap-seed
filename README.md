# Angular Bootstrap Seed Project

This project is the result of using [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) with bootstrap-sass, but slightly modified so bootstrap variables are available for the app styles. Further information can be found [here](http://david-barreto.com/improving-the-yeoman-generator-gulp-angular-sass/).
